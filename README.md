# Weather-Station-with-ESP8266-12E
A mini weather station with ESP8266-12E with data send to Blynk, Thingspeak


In this project, we will use an ESP8266-12E Wi-Fi MCU and measuring the weather information from 
these digital sensors: BH1750, BM180, DHT11, we display on the OLED screen, read the data from Blynk
